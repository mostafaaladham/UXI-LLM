## Introduction

The **UXI-LLM** framework provides a robust solution for developers looking to implement language models in a modular way. Its design allows for easy extensibility and high performance, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. This framework is particularly useful for those who want to integrate AI into their user experience seamlessly.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily customize and extend the framework to fit your needs.
- **Symbolic Reasoning**: Incorporate symbolic reasoning capabilities into your applications.
- **Local Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune models locally for better performance and relevance.
- **Full-Language Interoperability**: Work with multiple languages without restrictions.
- **Composable Reasoning**: Combine different reasoning methods to enhance decision-making.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to and learn from an open-source community.

## Installation

To get started with **UXI-LLM**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mostafaaladham/UXI-LLM.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd UXI-LLM
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   python setup.py install
   ```

## Usage

Using **UXI-LLM** is straightforward. Below are some examples to help you get started.

### Basic Example

To create a simple LLM instance, use the following code:

```python
from uxi_llm import LLM

model = LLM(model_name='your_model_name')
response = model.generate("Hello, how can I help you?")
print(response)
```

### Fine-Tuning

To fine-tune a model locally, follow these steps:

```python
model.fine_tune(training_data='path/to/your/data')
```

### Composable Reasoning

You can also utilize composable reasoning methods:

```python
from uxi_llm import ComposableReasoning

reasoning = ComposableReasoning()
result = reasoning.combine(methods=['method1', 'method2'], input_data='some_input')
print(result)
```
